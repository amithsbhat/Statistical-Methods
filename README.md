A paired t-test is designed to compare the means of the same group or item under two separate scenarios. 
An unpaired t-test compares the means of two independent or unrelated groups.
In an unpaired t-test, the variance between groups is assumed to be equal. 
In a paired t-test, the variance is not assumed to be equal
